The final project for Introduction to Python

### Description
This program allows users to explore bikeshare data from three US cities (New York, Chiago, Washington).
It is an interactive program that allows users to view data from the cites with the option of adding time filters based on month or day of the week.

### Files used
ADobres_bikeshare.py (main program file)
Users will also need the following data files located in the data folder:
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
The filepaths for this data must be specificed in the inital lines of the ADobres_bikeshare.py code

[NB for the Github repo only samples of the data have been uploaded due to the large size of the full files]

### Latest updates
